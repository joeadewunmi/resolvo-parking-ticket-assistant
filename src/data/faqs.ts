    question: "What is Resolvo?",
    answer: "Resolvo is an AI-powered tool designed to help people challenge their parking tickets using the latest UK parking laws. It reviews your specific situation, references the correct laws and regulations, and creates a strong, personalised appeal letter in minutes.\n\nEach year in the UK, millions of parking tickets are issued, often due to unclear signage, technical errors, or confusing rules. Resolvo simplifies the appeals process, helping people fight unfair fines with confidence by creating legally-sound appeals based on current parking regulations.\n\nNote: Resolvo supports appeals for both private parking tickets and council-issued Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs). However, it does not handle Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) for moving traffic violations, which typically require a court appeal."

  },
  {
    question: "How does Resolvo work?",
    answer: "Resolvo uses artificial intelligence to analyse your unique situation and match it with the latest UK parking laws. Here's how the process works:\n\n1. You describe your parking situation and ticket details to Resolvo\n2. Resolvo asks you clarifying questions to gather all necessary information\n3. The AI analyses your case against current UK parking regulations and case law\n4. Resolvo identifies the strongest legal grounds for your appeal based on your circumstances\n5. A personalised appeal letter is instantly created, citing relevant laws and precedents\n6. You receive the completed letter that you can send directly to the parking company or council\n\nThe entire process takes just minutes, compared to the hours it might take to research and write an appeal yourself."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have multiple tickets?",
    answer: "No problem—Resolvo can help with multiple parking tickets. For each ticket, simply start a new chat with Resolvo and follow the same process. This ensures that each appeal is tailored specifically to the circumstances of that particular ticket.\n\nEach parking ticket usually has different details (dates, locations, alleged violations), so having separate appeals gives you the best chance of success. Resolvo will create customised appeals for each one based on the specific details you provide."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to talk to someone on the phone?",
    answer: "No, you don't need to make any phone calls or speak to anyone directly. The entire process happens through text chat with our AI assistant. Your appeal letter is created online instantly, and you can submit it according to the instructions provided by the parking company or council (usually via email or their online portal).\n\nThis makes the process convenient and accessible, especially for people who prefer not to handle phone calls or face-to-face interactions when dealing with appeals."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this legal advice?",
    answer: "Resolvo offers guidance on handling parking tickets and creates appeal letters based on current UK parking regulations, but it's not formal legal advice. If you need legal representation or have a particularly complex case that may go to court, we recommend contacting a qualified lawyer.\n\nThat said, Resolvo's appeals have helped many people successfully challenge their parking tickets by creating compelling arguments based on parking laws and regulations. Our AI is specifically trained on UK parking regulations and relevant case law to provide accurate information for standard parking ticket situations."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Resolvo protect my privacy?",
    answer: "Your information is completely private and secure. We never share your personal details with anyone. Resolvo only asks for information necessary to create your appeal letter, and your conversation history is protected by OpenAI's privacy standards.\n\nWe don't store copies of your completed appeal letters or personal information outside of the chat environment. This means your sensitive information remains confidential throughout the entire process.\n\nFor more information about our privacy practices, please refer to our Privacy Policy."

  {
    question: "When can I use Resolvo?",
    answer: "Resolvo is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! You can use our service anytime that's convenient for you, whether it's early morning, late at night, or on weekends and holidays.\n\nThis round-the-clock availability is especially helpful since many parking tickets have strict appeal deadlines (typically 14-28 days). With Resolvo, you can create your appeal as soon as you receive your ticket, without waiting for business hours or scheduling an appointment."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Resolvo different from regular ChatGPT?",
    answer: "Yes, Resolvo is significantly different from regular ChatGPT. While both use AI technology, Resolvo is specifically trained on the latest UK parking regulations, relevant case law, and appeal strategies to help with parking ticket appeals.\n\nRegular ChatGPT's training data stops at a certain point and isn't regularly updated on specific legal matters. Resolvo, however, is continuously updated with the latest parking laws and regulations to ensure your appeal reflects current legal standards.\n\nResolvo also follows a structured approach designed specifically for parking appeals, asking relevant questions and generating formatted appeal letters ready for submission—specialized capabilities that general AI chatbots don't offer."

  },
  {
    question: "How successful are parking ticket appeals?",
    answer: "Success rates for parking ticket appeals vary depending on the circumstances, but many appeals are successful when they identify valid grounds for challenge. According to industry statistics, up to 40-60% of appealed parking tickets can be canceled when properly contested.\n\nResolvo helps increase your chances of success by identifying the strongest legal arguments based on your specific situation and creating professionally written appeals that cite relevant regulations.

  {
    question: "What are common grounds for appealing parking tickets?",
    answer: "There are many valid grounds for appealing parking tickets, including:\n\n• Unclear, inadequate, or misleading signage\n• Technical errors on the ticket (wrong date, time, vehicle details, etc.)\n• Payment machine malfunctions or issues with mobile payment apps\n• Valid permit or ticket was displayed but not seen or had slightly fallen\n• Genuine emergency situations\n• Vehicle breakdown or mechanical issues\n• Ticket issued while loading/unloading (in permitted circumstances)\n• Mitigating circumstances (medical emergency, helping vulnerable person, etc.)\n• Issues with parking operator's compliance with industry codes of practice\n• Evidence that contradicts the alleged violation\n\nResolvo will help identify which grounds apply to your specific situation and create an appeal that emphasizes the strongest arguments."
