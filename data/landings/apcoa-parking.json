      "question": "What happens if my first appeal to APCOA Parking is rejected?",
      "answer": "If your initial appeal is rejected, you can escalate your case to POPLA (Parking on Private Land Appeals), an independent appeals service. You'll have 28 days from receiving the rejection to submit your POPLA appeal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does APCOA Parking have to follow a code of practice?",
      "answer": "Yes, APCOA Parking is a member of the British Parking Association (BPA) and must follow their Approved Operator Scheme Code of Practice. Violations of this code can be grounds for appeal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a discount on my APCOA Parking fine?",
      "answer": "APCOA Parking typically offers a 40-50% discount if you pay within 14 days of receiving the ticket. However, once you appeal, this discount period is usually put on hold until they respond."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I include photos or evidence with my APCOA Parking appeal?",
      "answer": "Yes, evidence strengthens your case. Photos of unclear signage, faulty machines, your valid ticket, or other relevant evidence should be included with your appeal when possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will an APCOA Parking fine affect my credit score?",
      "answer": "A parking charge itself won't directly affect your credit score. However, if APCOA Parking takes you to court, obtains a judgment against you, and you don't pay, this could impact your credit rating."
