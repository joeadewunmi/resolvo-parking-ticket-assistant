    },
    {
      "question": "What are common grounds for appealing a Euro Car Parks ticket?",
      "answer": "Common grounds include: unclear signage, payment machine issues, valid ticket but displayed incorrectly, mitigating circumstances, or errors in the PCN details."

    {
      "question": "How successful are appeals against Euro Car Parks?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my first appeal to Euro Car Parks is rejected?",
      "answer": "If your initial appeal is rejected, you can escalate your case to POPLA (Parking on Private Land Appeals), an independent appeals service. You'll have 28 days from receiving the rejection to submit your POPLA appeal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Euro Car Parks have to follow a code of practice?",
      "answer": "Yes, Euro Car Parks is a member of the British Parking Association (BPA) and must follow their Approved Operator Scheme Code of Practice. Violations of this code can be grounds for appeal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a discount on my Euro Car Parks fine?",
      "answer": "Euro Car Parks typically offers a 40-50% discount if you pay within 14 days of receiving the ticket. However, once you appeal, this discount period is usually put on hold until they respond."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I include photos or evidence with my Euro Car Parks appeal?",
      "answer": "Yes, evidence strengthens your case. Photos of unclear signage, faulty machines, your valid ticket, or other relevant evidence should be included with your appeal when possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will a Euro Car Parks fine affect my credit score?",
      "answer": "A parking charge itself won't directly affect your credit score. However, if Euro Car Parks takes you to court, obtains a judgment against you, and you don't pay, this could impact your credit rating."
