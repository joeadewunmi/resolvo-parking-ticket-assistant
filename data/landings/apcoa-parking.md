# Challenge Your APCOA Parking Ticket

APCOA Parking is one of the largest parking management companies in the UK. If you've received a parking charge notice (PCN) from APCOA, Resolvo can help you appeal it for free.

## About APCOA Parking

APCOA Parking operates car parks across the UK, including hospital car parks, shopping centres, and public parking facilities. They use ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras to enforce parking rules and issue PCNs to those who overstay or don't pay correctly.

## Common Reasons to Appeal an APCOA Parking Ticket

There are several grounds for appealing an APCOA Parking ticket:

### Unclear Signage
If the parking terms weren't clearly displayed or were confusing, you may have grounds for appeal. Parking signs must be clear, visible, and unambiguous.

### Payment Issues
If you tried to pay but the machine was faulty, or if you made a minor error when entering your vehicle registration, you should appeal.

### Mitigating Circumstances
Medical emergencies, vehicle breakdowns, or other unexpected situations that prevented you from following the parking rules are valid reasons to appeal.

### Technical Errors
Mistakes in the PCN itself, such as incorrect vehicle details or location information, can invalidate the charge.
